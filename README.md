# Grocery-Recommendation-System

## Introduction
The Grocery Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to recommend grocery items to users based on their preferences and behaviors. The system utilizes collaborative filtering to recommend items by analyzing past interactions from multiple users, identifying patterns, and predicting which grocery products a user might like.

## Features
Recommends grocery items based on user preferences and behaviors.
Implements collaborative filtering techniques (user-based and item-based).
Interactive web interface to browse grocery items and get recommendations.
Dynamic display of grocery recommendations upon button click.
Scalable to integrate more advanced recommendation techniques or larger datasets.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask (or Streamlit for rapid prototyping)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
Recommendation Engine: Collaborative Filtering with Surprise Library
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Localhost or Cloud Platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS)

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package installer)
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation Steps
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/varshat/Grocery-Recommendation-System.git
cd Grocery-Recommendation-System
\n
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
\n
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
\n
Run the Flask application:
python app.py
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
\n
Dataset
This system can be trained on a grocery-related dataset where user interaction history with products is stored. Example datasets might include:
User IDs
Grocery product IDs
User ratings for the products
Timestamps of purchases
You can use publicly available datasets or generate synthetic data if required.

Example datasets:

Grocery User-Item Dataset
Amazon Grocery Ratings Dataset
The dataset is processed using Pandas and utilized by the recommendation engine to build the collaborative filtering model.

Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
The recommendation system uses Collaborative Filtering to generate recommendations:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: This method finds similar users based on their preferences and suggests items that other users with similar behavior have liked.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: This method finds similar items based on users' past ratings and interactions, recommending items similar to what the user has shown interest in.

The system uses the Surprise Library to implement the collaborative filtering models (KNNBasic, KNNWithMeans, or SVD) and generate predictions.
